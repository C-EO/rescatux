== BUILD INSTRUCTIONS ==

In order to build Rescatux in a Wheezy system or Wheezy chroot you need these packages:

live-build
imagemagick # Needed for logo generation
syslinux # Needed for logo generation

=== Build chntpw-ng ===

It doesn't matter too much if you build it from Wheezy or from an unstable system.
Current version that we use at Wheezy based Rescatux was originally built in Squeeze.

You will find chntpw-ng source code at: http://developer.berlios.de/project/showfiles.php?group_id=11211 .

Just check INSTALL.txt file on the package for build instructions.

Build will generate chntpw binary file.

Path to this file should be set at: make_common's CHNTPWNG_BINARY variable.

=== Isolinux based image ===

Edit these variables from make_common file if needed:

MIRROR_BOOTSTRAP
MIRROR_CHROOT
SID_MIRROR
BACKPORTED_PASSWD
CHNTPWNG_BINARY

Using an Wheezy system or chroot run at the Rescatux source code directory:

  ./make_rescatux.sh

This will generate an image like:
  rescatux-0.30b7.iso

=== SG2D based image ===

You need to have installed GNU GRUB2 in your system, at least the grub-mkrescue and grub-mkfont binaries.
You also need to have Super Grub2 Disk source code.

Edit SG2D_SOURCE_DIRECTORY variable in make_rescatux_sg2d_hybrid.sh file.
Its value should be path to your Super Grub2 Disk source code directory.

Using an unstable/wheezey system or chroot run at the Rescatux source code directory:

  ./make_rescatux_hybrid.sh

  and then:

  ./make_rescatux_sg2d_hybrid.sh

This will generate an image like:
  rescatux_cdrom_usb_hybrid_i386_486-amd64_0.30b8_sg2d.iso

=== Make source code ===

Just run:

  ./make_source_code.sh

in order to generate a file like:

  rescatux_source_code_0.30b6.tar.gz


=== Release ===

The files that usually conform a release are:

Rescatux iso:

  rescatux-0.30b7.iso

Rescatux iso md5sum file:

  rescatux-0.30b7.iso.md5

Rescatux source code:

  rescatux_source_code_0.30b8.tar.gz

=== Other notes ===

You can change Rescatux version at VERSION file.
