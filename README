This is Rescatux, a Debian Live CD aimed at easy rescue.

Please visit the official web page of Rescatux, for more information.
The URL is <http://www.supergrubdisk.org/rescatux/>.

== OBTAIN SOURCE CODE ==

You can obtain most recent source code from out git repository by issuing:

  git clone http://git.code.sf.net/p/rescatux/git rescatux-git

== BUILD INSTRUCTIONS ==

In order to build Rescatux in a Jessie system or Jessie chroot you need these packages:

live-build (patched as below)
imagemagick # Needed for logo generation
syslinux # Needed for logo generation
syslinux-utils # Needed for logo generation

== About chntpw build ==

Till the current bug in sampasswd (it does not save its changes)
and till samunlock is added upstream we need to build this program on our own.

Get chntpw source code from:

* branch : chntpw-ng-1.01
* repository : https://github.com/rescatux/chntpw

You might need to run:

ln -s /usr/include/asm-generic /usr/include/asm

so that the upstream source code builds ok

Then run (inside a Jessie chroot):
make

so that: samunlock, sampasswd, samunlock.static and sampasswd.static are generated.

Path to samunlock directory should be set at: make_common's CHNTPW_PATH variable.

== About tails-greeter build (Outdated in 0.40 beta 1) ==

I am using a tails-greeter fork while I try to get it integrated properly into Debian Live. Here there is how you need to build it (inside a Jessie chroot):

git clone https://github.com/rescatux/tails-greeter.git
cd greeter
git checkout rescatux_0.40b8
dpkg-buildpackage -us -uc

You need to define the deb path at: make_common's RESCATUX_TAILS_GREETER variable.

== Rescatux's Debian Live ==

I'm trying to push upstream (Debian Live) my improvements on Debian Live:

* Arch autodetection in Isolinux bootloader
* Support for loopback.cfg
* SElinux

in the meanwhile you need to get, build and install Debian Live's live-build package from:

https://github.com/rescatux/live-build/
(Tag: rescatux-0.40b7)

Then make sure you install:
policycoreutils
coreutils
packages so that SElinux support works ok.

=== Isolinux based image ===

Edit these variables from make_common file if needed:

MIRROR_BOOTSTRAP
MIRROR_CHROOT
SID_MIRROR
BACKPORTED_PASSWD
CHNTPW_PATH

Using an Jessie system or chroot run at the Rescatux source code directory:

  ./make_rescatux.sh

This will generate an image like:
  rescatux-0.30b7.iso
in rescatux-release directory.

=== SG2D based image ===

You need to have installed GNU GRUB2 in your system, at least the grub-mkrescue and grub-mkfont binaries.
You also need to have Super Grub2 Disk source code.

Edit SG2D_SOURCE_DIRECTORY variable in make_rescatux_sg2d.sh file.
Its value should be path to your Super Grub2 Disk source code directory.

Using an unstable/jessie system or chroot run at the Rescatux source code directory:

  ./make_rescatux.sh

  and then:

  ./make_rescatux_sg2d.sh

This will generate an image like:
  rescatux_cdrom_usb_hybrid_i386_486-amd64_0.30b8_sg2d.iso

=== Make source code ===

Just run:

  ./make_source_code.sh

in order to generate a file like:

  rescatux_source_code_0.30b6.tar.gz

which will be found on:

rescatux-release directory.

=== Release ===

The files that usually conform a release are:

Rescatux iso:

  rescatux-0.30b7.iso

Rescatux iso md5sum file:

  rescatux-0.30b7.iso.md5

Rescatux source code:

  rescatux_source_code_0.30b8.tar.gz

which will be found on:

rescatux-release directory.

=== Other notes ===

You can change Rescatux version at VERSION file.
