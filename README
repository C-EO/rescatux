This is Rescatux, a Debian Live CD aimed at easy rescue.

Please visit the official web page of Rescatux, for more information.
The URL is <http://www.supergrubdisk.org/rescatux/>.

== OBTAIN SOURCE CODE ==

You can obtain most recent source code from out git repository by issuing:

  git clone http://git.code.sf.net/p/rescatux/git rescatux-git

== BUILD INSTRUCTIONS ==

In order to build Rescatux in a Jessie system or Jessie chroot you need these packages:

live-build (patched as below)
imagemagick # Needed for logo generation
syslinux # Needed for logo generation
syslinux-utils # Needed for logo generation

If you want to build also source code you need the git package to be installed.

== About tails-greeter build ==

I am using a tails-greeter fork while I try to get it integrated properly into Debian Live. Here there is how you need to build it (inside a Jessie chroot):

git clone https://github.com/rescatux/tails-greeter.git
cd greeter
git checkout rescatux_0.40b8
dpkg-buildpackage -us -uc

You need to define the deb path at: make_common's RESCATUX_TAILS_GREETER variable.

== Rescatux's Debian Live ==

I'm trying to push upstream (Debian Live) my improvements on Debian Live:

* Arch autodetection in Isolinux bootloader
* Support for loopback.cfg
* SElinux

in the meanwhile you need to get, build and install Debian Live's live-build package from:

https://github.com/rescatux/live-build/
(Tag: rescatux-0.40b7)

Then make sure you install:
policycoreutils
coreutils
packages so that SElinux support works ok.

=== Isolinux based image ===

Edit these variables from make_common file if needed:

MIRROR_BOOTSTRAP
MIRROR_CHROOT
SID_MIRROR
BACKPORTED_PASSWD

Using an Jessie system or chroot run at the Rescatux source code directory:

  ./make-rescatux.sh

This will generate an image like:
  rescatux-0.30b7.iso
in rescatux-release directory.

=== SG2D based image ===

You need to have installed GNU GRUB2 in your system, at least the grub-mkrescue and grub-mkfont binaries.
You also need to have Super Grub2 Disk source code.

Edit SG2D_SOURCE_DIRECTORY variable in make-rescatux-sg2d.sh file.
Its value should be path to your Super Grub2 Disk source code directory.

Using an unstable/jessie system or chroot run at the Rescatux source code directory:

  ./make-rescatux.sh

  and then:

  ./make-rescatux-sg2d.sh

This will generate an image like:
  rescatux_cdrom_usb_hybrid_i386_486-amd64_0.30b8_sg2d.iso

=== Make source code ===

Just run:

  make-rescatux-and-source-code.sh

which will generate many source code files at:

rescatux-release/source-code directory.

=== Release ===

The files that usually conform a release are:

Rescatux iso:

  rescatux-0.30b7.iso

Rescatux iso md5sum file:

  rescatux-0.30b7.iso.md5

Rescatux source code:

  rescatux_source_code_0.30b8.tar.gz

which will be found on:

rescatux-release directory.

=== Other notes ===

You can change Rescatux version at VERSION file.
