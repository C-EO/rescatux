== OBTAIN SOURCE CODE ==

You can obtain most recent source code from out git repository by issuing:

  git clone http://git.code.sf.net/p/rescatux/git rescatux-git

== BUILD INSTRUCTIONS ==

In order to build Rescatux in a Wheezy system or Wheezy chroot you need these packages:

live-build (patched as below)
imagemagick # Needed for logo generation
syslinux # Needed for logo generation

=== Build chntpw-ng ===

It doesn't matter too much if you build it from Wheezy or from an unstable system.
Current version that we use at Wheezy based Rescatux was originally built in Squeeze.

You will find chntpw-ng source code at: http://developer.berlios.de/project/showfiles.php?group_id=11211 .

Just check INSTALL.txt file on the package for build instructions.

Build will generate chntpw binary file.

Path to this file should be set at: make_common's CHNTPWNG_BINARY variable.

== Debian Live needed patches ==

A per current version of live-build package it needs patching (On your wheezy or wheezy chroot system) so that two features work ok:
* Arch autodetection in Isolinux bootloader
* Support for loopback.cfg

If you want to know if the patches are no longer needed please check these associated bugs. You will see in which live-build version they are finally fixed.

* https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=757697
* https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=757883

Here there is a mini script for applying these patches.

#!/bin/bash
CURRENT_DIR=$(pwd)
cd /
BACKUP_SUFFIX="_backup_rescatux_$(date +'%F-%H-%M')"
cp -a /usr/lib/live/build/binary_syslinux /usr/lib/live/build/binary_syslinux${BACKUP_SUFFIX}
cp -a /usr/lib/live/build/binary /usr/lib/live/build/binary${BACKUP_SUFFIX}
patch -p1 < ${CURRENT_DIR}/debian-live-patches/debian_live_cpu64bit_detection.diff
patch -p1 < ${CURRENT_DIR}/debian-live-patches/debian_live_loopback_cfg_support.diff
cd ${CURRENT_DIR}

The patches are found in: debian-live-patches directory.

=== Isolinux based image ===

Edit these variables from make_common file if needed:

MIRROR_BOOTSTRAP
MIRROR_CHROOT
SID_MIRROR
BACKPORTED_PASSWD
CHNTPWNG_BINARY

Using an Wheezy system or chroot run at the Rescatux source code directory:

  ./make_rescatux.sh

This will generate an image like:
  rescatux-0.30b7.iso
in rescatux-release directory.

=== SG2D based image ===

You need to have installed GNU GRUB2 in your system, at least the grub-mkrescue and grub-mkfont binaries.
You also need to have Super Grub2 Disk source code.

Edit SG2D_SOURCE_DIRECTORY variable in make_rescatux_sg2d.sh file.
Its value should be path to your Super Grub2 Disk source code directory.

Using an unstable/wheezey system or chroot run at the Rescatux source code directory:

  ./make_rescatux.sh

  and then:

  ./make_rescatux_sg2d.sh

This will generate an image like:
  rescatux_cdrom_usb_hybrid_i386_486-amd64_0.30b8_sg2d.iso

=== Make source code ===

  ./make_source_code.sh

in order to generate a file like:

  rescatux_source_code_0.30b6.tar.gz

which will be found on:

rescatux-release directory.

Rescatux iso:
